We recommand to use the notebook (.ipynb) but the Python script (.py) is also provided if more convenient for you.

# How to submit your Work ?

This work must be done individually. The expected output is a private repository named gan-cgan on https://gitlab.ec-lyon.fr. It must contain your notebook (or python files) and a README.md file that explains briefly the successive steps of the project. Don't forget to add your teacher as developer member of the project. The last commit is due before 11:59 pm on Monday, April 1st, 2024. Subsequent commits will not be considered.
