## Tutorial 1 - Victor Ludvig

In this tutorial, we use simple methods to classify data.
First, trees are used to make the classifications, see [travail1.ipynb](travail1.ipynb). The scikit-learn library is used. <br>
Then the naive Bayes classification method is implemented from scratch with python, see [travail2.ipynb](travail2.ipynb).
